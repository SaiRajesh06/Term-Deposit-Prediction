# Term-Deposit-Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict whether a customer will accept a term deposit from the bank after being contacted by the executives. The prediction will be used by the executives to focus on the right demographic. It is mainly used in banks and financial organizations, considering factors such as age, education level, employment status, and past banking actions. Three machine learning models - Logistic Regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes - will be employed for this task.

## Objective
The main goal is to predict term deposit subscriptions in banks using customer data, which includes demographics, past banking actions, and other relevant information.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls, and often, more than one contact to the same client was required to determine if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed or not.

## Related Works
- The models are compared using performance indicators including accuracy and precision.
- Based on the data analysis, regression analysis, KNN classifier, and Naive Bayes classifier are considered appropriate choices to predict term deposit subscriptions.

## Methods
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Data Analysis (visualization)
3. Applying correlation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation / Testing

## Achievement
- This project aims to harness the power of machine learning by facilitating data-driven decision-making in the banking sector.
- Enable banks to optimize their marketing plans by targeting customers more likely to subscribe to term deposits.

## Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning techniques and customer data, this project aims to accurately predict term deposit subscriptions, allowing banks to implement targeted marketing strategies and optimize their operations.
